# bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app takes the user's commands, processes orders and updates the stock quantity for the store's inventory.\
\
Below are a few images demonstrating how the app works.\
\
In this particular store, there are 10 items inspired by strange products that are actually available for purchase online. The user will have to scroll through to view all 10 options.\

In the screen shot below, the user has chosen the Inflatable Unicorn Horn for Cats, and since there was a sufficient quantity, they received the message "Plenty In Stock!" and were asked if they would like to continue shopping. Throughout the user's shopping experience, the app will track the total price of the items saved to the shopping cart.\

Below, the user has selected more units of Bacon Flavored Floss than are available for purchase. This returns the user to the full list of products so they can continue shopping.\
