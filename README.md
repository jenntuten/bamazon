# bamazon
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app takes the user's commands, processes orders and updates the stock quantity for the store's inventory.\
\
Below are a few images demonstrating how the app works.\
\
In this particular store, there are 10 items inspired by strange products that are actually available for purchase online. The user will have to scroll through to view all 10 options.\

\
In the screen shot below, the user has chosen the Inflatable Unicorn Horn for Cats, and since there was a sufficient quantity, they received the message "Plenty In Stock!" and were asked if they would like to continue shopping.\

\
When a user enters an invalid item number or enters non-numeric characters when requesting a specific quantity, they will receive an error message. This returns the user to the full list of products so they can continue shopping.\

\
If the user enters a quantity above what's available in inventory, they will receive a message and will be able to update their selection.\

\
On this final screen, the user has opted to check out, and the app has calculated the total price of the items in the shopping cart.\
